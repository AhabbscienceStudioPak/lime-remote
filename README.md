# Lime Remote

Gyroscopic mouse input for desktops using a smartphone.

The project is inspired by Logitech's [Spotlight Presentation Remote](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/spotlight-presentation-remote).

## iOS

["iPhone iOS 12.2 will disable gyroscope access by default."](https://discourse.threejs.org/t/iphone-ios-12-2-will-disable-gyroscope-access-by-default/6579)
Gyroscopic input can be enabled through Settings > Safari > Privacy & Security > Enable motion & orientation access.
